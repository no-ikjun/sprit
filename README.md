# Sprit

Welcome to Sprit ðŸ“š, your companion for consistent reading. Sprit is a Flutter-based application designed to encourage and track your reading habits, making every page turn towards your personal growth and knowledge expansion effortless and enjoyable.

## Getting Started

Sprit is developed using the robust and scalable Flutter framework, incorporating the Provider pattern for efficient state management and a reactive user interface. This project serves as a foundation for creating a Flutter application that not only looks appealing but also follows best practices for state management.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the Sprit codebase, make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If you're new to Flutter or need a refresher, here are a few resources to get you started:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For comprehensive Flutter documentation, including tutorials, samples, and a full API reference, visit the [Flutter online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/).

### Incorporating Provider Pattern

Sprit utilizes the Provider pattern for state management, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between the application's logic and presentation layers. This approach not only enhances code readability and maintainability but also simplifies state management across the app.

To learn more about the Provider pattern and how to use it in your Flutter projects, check out the following resources:

- [Simple app state management](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple)
- [Provider package on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
